## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of seven large language models across different prompting strategies for educational AI applications. Through systematic testing of 42 model-approach combinations, we demonstrate that ground rules-based prompting consistently outperforms structured templates while revealing significant performance variations across model families.
