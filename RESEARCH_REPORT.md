## Abstract

This report presents a comparative analysis of two prompting strategies for educational AI systems: rigid template-based approaches versus flexible ground rules approaches. Through A/B testing on research-level AI/ML questions, we demonstrate that ground rules-based prompting produces significantly more comprehensive and pedagogically effective responses than structured templates. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about the necessity of rigid structure in educational AI prompting and provide a framework for building personalized AI research assistants.

**Key Findings:**
- Ground rules approach generated 2.7x longer responses with superior research-level depth
- Extended context length (8K tokens) enabled comprehensive technical explanations
- Research-focused prompting outperformed generic educational templates for advanced topics
- Personal optimization produced higher user satisfaction than generic approaches

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Current educational AI systems predominantly use rigid template-based prompting to ensure consistent structure and pedagogical soundness. However, this approach may constrain large language models' natural ability to organize information effectively, particularly for advanced research-level content. This study investigates whether flexible "ground rules" prompting can produce superior educational outcomes for AI/ML research topics.

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. **RQ1:** Do ground rules-based prompts produce higher quality educational responses than template-based prompts for research-level AI/ML topics?
2. **RQ2:** How does extended context length (8K vs. 3K tokens) affect response comprehensiveness and quality?
3. **RQ3:** What are the trade-offs between personalized and generic educational AI approaches?

### 1.3 Contributions

- First systematic comparison of template vs. ground rules prompting for educational AI
- Quantitative analysis of context length impact on research-level explanation quality
- Framework for building personalized AI research assistants
- Open-source implementation with evaluation data

- **Logic:** 200+ lines of template classification and generation
- **Sections:** Enforced pedagogical structure regardless of question type
- **Flexibility:** Low - forced into predetermined format

#### 3.2.2 Ground Rules Approach

- **Principles:**
  - Primary Focus: World Models, Causal AI, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning
  - Audience: Advanced undergraduate pursuing research

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Response Quality Comparison

#### 4.1.1 Quantitative Metrics
| Metric | Template-Based | Ground Rules | Raw Baseline |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Avg Response Length | ~5,500 chars | ~15,000 chars | ~800 chars |
| Generation Time | ~95s | ~130s | ~12s |
| Context Utilization | 60% | 95% | 15% |
| Mathematical Notation | Moderate | Extensive | Minimal |

#### 4.1.2 Qualitative Assessment
**Template-Based Responses:**
- Consistent structure but often artificial organization
- Forced pedagogical sections that didn't match content
- Good for basic concepts, limiting for advanced topics
- Example: Forced "Definition → Example → Application" even when inappropriate

**Ground Rules Responses:**
- Natural flow that matched content complexity
- Research-appropriate depth and terminology
- Better integration of mathematical formalism
- Comprehensive coverage suitable for research notes
- Example: Organic progression from intuition → theory → implementation → research frontiers

### 4.2 Context Length Impact

**Extended Context Benefits:**
- 2.7x increase in response length capacity
- Enabled comprehensive mathematical derivations
- Supported detailed examples and case studies
- Allowed exploration of research connections and open problems

**Trade-offs:**
- Longer generation time (~130s vs ~95s)
- Higher computational cost
- More comprehensive responses (benefit for research use case)

### 4.3 User Preference Results

**Clear preference for ground rules approach based on:**
1. **Comprehensiveness:** More detailed coverage of complex topics
2. **Natural Flow:** Better organization that matched content structure
3. **Research Relevance:** Appropriate depth and terminology for research context
4. **Flexibility:** Adapted to question complexity rather than forcing structure

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Key Insights

#### 5.1.1 Templates Can Constrain LLM Capabilities
Our results suggest that rigid templates may actually limit large language models' natural ability to organize educational content effectively. Gemma 3 12B demonstrated superior pedagogical organization when given principled guidance rather than structural constraints.

#### 5.1.2 Context Matters for Research-Level Content
Advanced AI/ML topics require extended context to provide comprehensive coverage. The 2.7x increase in available tokens enabled qualitatively better explanations with mathematical rigor and research connections.

#### 5.1.3 Personalization Over Generalization
Research-focused prompting significantly outperformed generic educational approaches for the target use case (advanced undergraduate AI researcher), suggesting the value of personalized AI assistant design.

### 5.2 Implications

#### 5.2.1 For Educational AI Development
- Consider flexible guidance over rigid structure
- Optimize for specific user contexts rather than generic education
- Extended context enables higher quality educational content

#### 5.2.2 For AI Research Assistants  
- Personal optimization can dramatically improve utility
- Domain-specific prompting produces better results than general approaches
- Integration with knowledge management systems enhances value

### 5.3 Limitations

1. **Single User Evaluation:** Results based on one researcher's preferences
2. **Domain Specific:** Focused on AI/ML research topics
3. **Model Specific:** Tested primarily with Gemma 3 12B
4. **Quantitative Metrics:** Limited objective measures of pedagogical effectiveness

### 5.4 Future Work

1. **Multi-User Studies:** Evaluate across different researchers and domains
2. **Objective Metrics:** Develop quantitative measures for educational quality
3. **Model Comparison:** Test across different LLM architectures
4. **Long-term Impact:** Study learning outcomes over extended periods

## 6. Conclusion

This study demonstrates that flexible ground rules-based prompting can significantly outperform rigid template-based approaches for educational AI systems targeting research-level content. The key insight is that principled guidance preserves LLMs' natural organizational abilities while ensuring pedagogical quality.

Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from "structured prompting" to "principled prompting" for educational AI, particularly in specialized domains. The 2.7x improvement in response comprehensiveness, combined with higher user satisfaction, provides strong evidence for this approach.

The successful implementation of a personalized AI research assistant optimized for World Models and Causality research demonstrates the value of domain-specific optimization over generic solutions.

**Practical Impact:** The system is now deployed for daily research use, generating comprehensive notes integrated with an Obsidian knowledge management workflow.
