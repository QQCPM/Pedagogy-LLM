# Educational LLM Specialization Project

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Fine-tune Gemma 3 12B to provide structured, pedagogically effective explanations for technical subjects (math, AI/ML, physics).

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
```

2. **Run Baseline Evaluation**:
```bash
python gemma_inference.py  # Test model inference
python evaluation_framework.py  # Create evaluation dataset
```

3. **Monitor System**:
```bash
python monitor.py  # Check GPU/memory status
```

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py                 # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ gemma_inference.py         # Model inference with memory optimization
